                When starting this assignment, it was initially forced as we were simply following the prompts given on in the instructions. 
                This created very concrete and short answers that did not help to better understand the other person. However, when talking about 
                social identity and culture and their relationship with student leadership opportunities on campus, this opened up the possibility 
                to have a deeper conversation. This allowed us to have conversations about family culture and their experience at the University of 
                Michigan, overall. Over time, this assignment became easier as conversation topics were more free flowing and allowed us to learn 
                more about one another. From this experience, I learned more about the importance of setting and structure of the conversation. As 
                we initially entered this process knowing that a particular task needed to be accomplished, it limited our ability to create a space 
                in which we could connect. However, after breaking those barriers, conversations were more casual. This connects back to previous 
                experiences that I have learned how the environment can determine the overall outlook in the conversation. Typically most of these 
                conversations occur during ice-breakers or at the beginning of the semester when I am trying to build connections within my classes. 
                Despite this, I also have experience both in ResStaff and within my professional development as I have conducted many informal 
                interviews that required the appropriate setting in order of creating that natural conversation. Without this, then the dialogue 
                becomes very dry and ingenuine, not allowing the other individual to feel comfortable and safe to share their opinions. 
                <br>
                This is important during my time on ResStaff as I need to learn how to use the spaces given to make residents feel more comfortable, 
                which is crucial for my role. As someone who may need to have difficult conversations in my community, it is also important to 
                establish the foundational understanding through initiating simple dialogue. Through this, it allows residents to recognize and 
                understand that you are on a similar level to them and that there are similarities between the different individuals in the 
                conversation. Moving forward, I hope to continue building on this skill, which may need to be more adaptive and creative when 
                looking ahead to the upcoming election season. As different opinions may be shared across campuses, it is important, as a ResStaff 
                member, to facilitate dialogue that allows for individuals to feel safe to share their values. Therefore, I must utilize the traits 
                and skills emphasized during this activity in order of better preparing for changing climates and experiences that may occur in our 
                communities.
