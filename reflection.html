            <h3>Testimonial Reflection</h3>
            <h4>Date: February 11, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                After reflecting on the testimonials session this past Sunday, I noticed a lot of trends when comparing narratives from the 
                individuals in my group. Many people discussed their experience in navigating race, gender, ethnicity, and nationality. 
                Despite this, there was little conversation surrounding sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age and body size 
                (where one individual discussed sizeism). This could be due to the fact that people did not feel comfortable talking about 
                identities that were more “hidden” or not visibly apparent/ assumed. As you can and should not make assumptions of someone’s 
                identity based on the different social identities that were not discussed in testimonials, it would require an individual 
                taking an additional step to further explain context and background, if they feel comfortable. Although I cannot speak for 
                everyone, I felt more comfortable discussing identities that were most apparent as people could directly see the identities 
                that I highlighted in my testimonial. Therefore, I felt that people would better recognize the differences in identities and 
                the privileges that they hold if they could see it clearly. 
                <br>
                
                In terms of discussing the experiences shared for each identity, I think it was important to see the commonalities and trends. 
                For example, the privileged identities often had similar narratives of people not recognizing their own privilege initially, 
                until they were placed in an environment where someone expressed opposing ideas or witnessed poor treatment. This became an 
                important step in their journey as each individual was able to reflect on these experiences in order of growing to better 
                acknowledge their privilege. However, differing trends occurred when discussing the marginalized identities but two common 
                trends arose: either people always knew that their identity would bring challenges or they did not know until a specific 
                interaction or event. Either way, both pushed individuals to reconsider how they present themselves in different spaces in 
                order of protecting themselves and/or making their voices heard. 
                
                <br>
                This will become important when stepping into the larger communities as storytelling will be a great way to allow residents 
                and staff members to recognize commonalities and learn more about the people around them. However, in order to do this, there
                 needs to be a safe space in which students will feel comfortable sharing their own stories. When done appropriately, students
                  can share their experiences and put them in a vulnerable place without feeling like they will be denounced or judged for 
                  their stories. Ultimately, this exercise has exposed an as aspect of vulnerability and the beauty of storytelling as it 
                  helps individuals gain insight onto another side of their identity that is not commonly shared. Overall reflecting on this 
                  experience, the one question I have for the group is, “how did you feel after sharing your experience? What were the 
                  reactions that you were expecting, if any?”
